My code is included in the "Detector_FasterRCNN_copy.ipynb" file. For my code, the  "/content/drive/MyDrive/9517_augmented" part in all directories can be just regarded as the root of this branch (or the root of the main branch is also ok).
And I generated two json files during coding process to help run the built-in model.
